Data Analysis Project

Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of IMDB_dataset using SQL for data extraction, transformation, and processing, and Power BI for visualization and reporting. 
Project Structure
1. SQL Analysis

The SQL scripts included in this project were used to:

    Data Extraction: Queries were written to extract relevant data from the database.
    Data Cleaning: Data was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering out invalid records.
    Data Transformation: CTEs and other SQL techniques were employed to transform the data, including calculating key metrics, aggregating data, and joining multiple tables.
    Statistical Analysis: Correlation and other statistical measures were calculated to uncover relationships between variables (e.g., correlation between IMDB_Rating and gross revenue).

2. Power BI Visualization

The Power BI file contains the visual representation of the data insights, including:

    Dashboard: An interactive dashboard that provides a high-level overview of key metrics and KPIs.
    Visualizations: Various charts and graphs (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, etc.) that highlight important patterns and relationships in the data.

How to Use
Prerequisites

    SQL: A MySQL or PostgreSQL environment with the necessary permissions to run the SQL scripts.
    Power BI: Power BI Desktop installed to view and interact with the .pbix file.

Running SQL Scripts

    Open your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin).
    Load and execute the provided SQL scripts in the specified order.

Viewing Power BI Reports

    Open the provided .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
    Explore the various dashboards and reports to gain insights from the data.

Files Included

    SQL Scripts:
        data_extraction.sql: Extracts data from the database.
        data_transformation.sql: Cleans and transforms the data.
        correlation_analysis.sql: Calculates correlation and other statistics.

    Power BI File:
        data_analysis_report.pbix: Contains the Power BI dashboards and reports.
